# StoneTrack

There are uncountable products produced and getting destructed each millisecond on this planet earth.
This is a project aiming to track any product and its trace, How it reached your hands where it travelled and who was involved in it.


A Universal barcode that can be printed easily and just adds information about the product and stores it in the blockchain to enable the source of truth is maintained.
Plain Crazy Idea.! with a placeholder.
